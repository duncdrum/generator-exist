> exist app scaffolding

The generator creates directory and file scaffolds for different types of exist-db EXpath packages. Just answer the prompts about what you want to build, and a sensible directory structure with configured readmes, buildfiles, etc will be set up for you.

No more manual closing of html5 tags, or manually inserting app names into config files.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-exist using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-exist
npm install -g git://duncdrum/generator-exist.git
```

Then generate your new project: Create a new project folder and navigate to it in you CLI.

```bash
mkdir myApp
cd myApp
```

Then run the generator:
```bash
yo exist
```

Note: If you told yeoman to use Github for your new project, your project will start initialized with all files added, out of the box.

## Development
If you want to contribute another template or option, please take a look at the issue tracker. Pull request are always welcome. This generator uses `mocha` for unit testing. Please make sure to add tests when opening a PR.
