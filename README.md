> exist app scaffolding

Let [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) take care of creating directory and file scaffolds for different types of [exist-db](https://exist-db.org) EXpath packages. Just answer the prompts about what you want to build, and a sensible directory structure with fully configured readmes, buildfiles, etc will be set up for you.

No more manual closing of html5 tags, inserting app names into config files, or wondering if you actually increase the version number in all the places.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-exist using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

### Beta Version
The generator is still in beta and under development. While it has been working for me for quite some time, there are still things that need to be addressed before releasing it.

You can install and use the program locally while it is still in beta.
The following should install the generator on your local system.
```bash
npm install -g git://duncdrum/generator-exist.git
npm link exist-generator
```

### Official release
```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-exist
```

Then generate your new project: Create a new project folder and navigate to it in you CLI.

```bash
mkdir myApp
cd myApp
```

Then run the generator:
```bash
yo exist
```

Note: If you told yeoman to use Github for your new project, your project will start initialized with all files added, out of the box.

## Development
If you want to contribute another template or option, please take a look at the issue tracker. Pull request are always welcome. This generator uses `mocha` for unit testing. Please make sure to add tests when opening a PR.
